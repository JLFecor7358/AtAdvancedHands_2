This project is hands on exercise of Agilethought Automation Advance course

Create a program that:
1. Contain a delegate that will get 2 decimal values and returns a float value
2. Create an operation class with 2 methods, GetTaxCalculation (subtotal*tax percentage) and GetTotal (subtotal + tax)
3. The operation class will contain a third method that will receive a delegate and 2 decimals as a parameters so we can perform the call of the 2 above methods
4. The main program must create an operation object and use the delegate to get and print the tax value, and also to get and print the total amount
5. Create a collection to call the object 5 times with the following values:
Subtotal | Tax rate
100 | .15
200 | .17
300 | .19
2500.15 | .25
2700.99 | .27
